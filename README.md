# gift_ideas
Around Christmas or my birthday people tend to ask me what kind of gifts I'd like.

I don't need a lot (I'm very privileged in that respect!) but it makes me hard to gift things to.
This can sometimes be awkward for people who want to get me a gift.
So I'm compiling a list of things I need, or would like, to offer as suggestions to people who want to gift me a thing.

Ideally, I'd like this to be a socially and environmentally responsible list, but I'm also not above a little bit of avarice.

If you think there's something I'd like or have expressed want for, feel free to open a PR!

## Charities

I'd love it if you donated to any of the following charities on my behalf:

- [Australian Conservation Fund](https://www.acf.org.au/donate)
- [Doctors without borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/)
- [World Wildlife Fund](https://www.worldwildlife.org/) or their [Australian branch specifically](http://www.wwf.org.au/)
- [Fairgo Australia](http://fairgoaustralia.com/)
- [The Cathy Freeman Foundation](https://www.cathyfreemanfoundation.org.au/)
- [Wikipedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give)

There's probably a bunch of others I'd be happy for people to donate to in my name, but I'd ask that you double-check that
the charity is ethical and ideally atheist or agnostic in its outlook. (You can skip, for example, [the](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/view-from-the-street/why-i-wont-be-supporting-the-salvation-army-this-christmas-20161207-gt5ohs.html) [Salvation Army](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1f1vbm/dont_give_money_to_the_salvation_army_today_they/))

## Clothing

I'm pretty set for clothes most of the time, but I really appreciate unusual custom or hand-made items.
I once had a lightly stone-washed black shirt with three 'v's of colour just below the neck (purple, tan and grey) and
it was my favorite for years. (Until it finally met its end). I'm definitely interested in textures and colours
over printed pattern shirts if that helps?

* Interesting shirts (Size large)
